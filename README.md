A Websocket API to provide search functionality in Austria's Address register
as published under http://www.bev.gv.at/portal/page?_pageid=713,2601271&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL

This package relies on the workings of these other components:

* bevdockerdb, a PostGIS powered PostgreSQL installation with abbreviations and
  thesaurus dictionary for improved full text search;  
  [Github Project](https://github.com/the42/bevdockerdb)  
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/the42/bevdockerdb/)
* [bevaddress-dataload](https://github.com/the42/bevaddress-dataload), a set of scripts to load data into the aforementioned PostGIS database.

# Installation

## Install locally using

    go get github.com/the42/bevaddressapi

Local installation requires a working [Golang environment](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Configuration and running
bevaddressapi accepts two environment variables for configuration:

`PORT` - the tcp port on which the websocket API will listen for incoming connections, defaults to 5000 if not set;
`SECPORT` - the tcp port on which the websocket API will listen for incoming TLS connections; If not set or empty, the service is only served unencrypted;
`DATABASE_URL` - a url defining the connection parameters to the database.

Currently only PostGIS is supported as the database backend. See the
[documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Connection_String_Parameters) on how to set this environment variable.

## Install using Docker
    docker pull the42/bevaddressapi

Running

    docker run -it --name bevadr -P -p 5000:5000 -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://<DB_username>:<DB_password>@<DB_host>:<DB_port>/bevaddress the42/bevaddressapi

Replace DB_.... wit the appropriate values to the [Address-database](https://hub.docker.com/r/the42/bevdockerdb/)

In case your database server does not support SSl-encryption use

    docker run -it --name bevadr -P -p 5000:5000 -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://<DB_username>:<DB_password>@<DB_host>:<DB_port>/bevaddress?sslmode=disable the42/bevaddressapi


# Usage

The fulltext search endpoint is exposed as a websocket and listens as following:

* `/ws/address/fts`: A websocket endpoint for full text search. Paramters:  
`q` url-encoded string for full text search  
`postfix` (optional, `false` (default); If set to `true`, search term(s) will also postfix match, eg. `Krems` will match the city Krems but also Kremsm√ºnster.
